 * this is a summary of how to test ldap_user manually.
 * it attempts to cover all facets of the automated simpletests
 **********************************************/
 
1. Disable and uninstall ldap_user module.
2. Clear any variables that may not have been uninstalled:
   DELETE FROM variable where name like 'ldap_user%'
2A. Delete the user(2) you use for testing.
3. Clear watchdog logs.
4. Enable ldap_user module and check watchdog logs
5. Prepare user settings/entity for testing
  -- add field_lname, field_fname, field_dept, and field_display_name text fields to user
 
 
6. Tests for LDAP User Provisioning and Synching from LDAP Entry 
6.A. Setup: Configure LDAP User for Provisioning Drupal Account from LDAP Entry
    A. Select enabled server
    B. Drupal Accoutn Provisioning: [x] On manual creation of Drupal user account...
    C. Existing Drupal User Account Conflict: [x] Associate Drupal account with LDAP Entry
    D. Application of Drupal Account settings to LDAP Authenticated Users: [x] Account Creating Settings ... do not affect...
    E. Basic Provisioning to LDAP Settings: for server, select "none"
    F. Rest Webservice: leave disabled
    G. Server mappings section.
       i. [givenname] -- to drupal user -> Field: First Name [x] on user creation [x] on user logon
       ii. [sn:0] -- to drupal user -> Field: Last Name [x] on user creation [x] on user logon
       iii. [givenname] [sn] -- to drupal user -> Field: Display Name [x] on user creation [x] on user logon
       iv. Physics -- to drupal user -> Field: Department [x] on user creation [x] on user logon
   
6.B. Event: drupal user create provision/synching.  Test synch.  (no create test because Drupal user is created before this.)
    A. Create new user via admin/people/create
    B. field_lname, field_fname, field_dept, and field_display_name should be visible and populated
    C. goto admin/config/people/ldap/user/test enter the username and hit the test button.  this will show the user object and entity
       if the devel module is enabled
       i.     user object->ldap_user_puid_sid should be the id of the server
       ii.    user object->ldap_user_puid should be the value of the puid attribute
       iii.   user object->ldap_user_puid_property  should be the name of the puid attribute
       iv.    user object->ldap_user_current_dn should be the dn of the ldap entry
       v.     user object->mail and init should be correct, matching email
       vii.   user authmap should be empty.  this record is only generated when account created via ldap authentication
 
6.C. Event: user logon/authenticate.  Test create drupal account.
    A.1. Change "Drupal Account Provisioning Options to only "on successful authentication"
         and uncheck the mappings in table on "on user creation" and "on user update".
    A.2. Authenticate with a user not in drupal (be sure user is deleted before test)
    B. view the user from the user list (admin/people/people) and make sure
         field_lname, field_fname, field_dept, and field_display_name should be visible and populated
    C. goto admin/config/people/ldap/user/test/<username> and hit the test button.  this will show the user object and entity
       if the devel module is enabled
       i.     user object->ldap_user_puid_sid should be the id of the server
       ii.    user object->ldap_user_puid should be the value of the puid attribute
       iii.   user object->ldap_user_puid_property  should be the name of the puid attribute
       iv.    user object->ldap_user_current_dn should be the dn of the ldap entry
       v.     user object->mail and init should be correct, matching email
       vii.   user authmap should have an entry where module=ldap_authentication and authname=username
    D. Manually change last name of user and save.
    E. Log user in again.
    F. Last Name should revert to LDAP provided last name.
       
       
       
9. Test ldap entry provisioning
    A. in ldap user settings (admin/config/people/ldap/user)
      - uncheck BASIC PROVISIONING TO DRUPAL ACCOUNT SETTINGS settings
      - enable an ldap server in BASIC PROVISIONING TO LDAP SETTINGS
      - check both "LDAP Entry Provisioning Options"
      - disable REST webservice
      - in mappings table (alter to fit your LDAP)
        -- [dn], 'to LDAP entry', 'user tokens', [x] on user creation, [x] on user update/save
             user tokens should be an expression that evaluates to a dn such as:
             "cn=[property.name],ou=people,dc=ldap,dc=mycompany,dc=com" or
             "cn=[field.field_lname], [field.field_fname],ou=people,dc=ldap,dc=mycompany,dc=com"
        -- [cn], 'to LDAP entry', 'Property: Username', [x] on user creation, [x] on user update/save
        -- [displayname], 'to LDAP entry', user tokens, [x] on user creation, [x] on user update/save, [field.field_fname] [field.field_lname]
        -- [guid], 'to LDAP entry', user tokens, [x] on user creation, mydrupalsite.com[property.uid]
        -- [provisioned], 'to LDAP entry', user tokens, [x] on user creation, drupal_intranet (note this is a constant)
           
    B.  Create and approve new user, populating first and last name.
        -- confirm that ldap entry exists with proper attributes
        
    C.  Change lastname and first name and save user
        -- confirm that appropriate attributes were changed in ldap entry
        
    D.  Delete user in drupal.
        -- confirm that ldap entry for user is removed.
