1.0 with ldap_user changes:

-- need to move data in admin/config/people/ldap/user on update.



Mapping and mapping UI Tasks:
- add validation
- add some CSS to make sections clearer and generally improve usability
- allow for feeds tamper plugins be configured and act on mappings
- add some js to disable disallowed directions for selected user attributes


Permanent Unique Identifier Tasks:

- write code to check and resolve conflict with puid
-- ldap_user_puid_to_user($puid)
-- ldap_user_user_to_puid($user)

- events to be addressed:
-- any ldap_user insert or update
-- any user logon

- should be in grid of when to update attributes as an attribut (PUID).

- PUID unit tests
-- add puid in configuration
-- test that puid is present when user is created
-- change puid in fake ldap server
-- update user and make sure new puid is set
-- change username in fake ldap server, but keep puid same
-- when user authenticates, make sure old account is converted to new username with old uid.
